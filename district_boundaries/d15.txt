The northern boundary is the King/Snohomish County line from 61st Ave NE, to Route 2, then following Route 2 to the King/Chelan County line (communities along both sides of Route 2 are registered in District 23).
The eastern boundary is the King/Chelan County line.
The southern boundary is an imaginary line following NE 8th Street directly west from the King/Chelan County line to the eastern shoreline of Lake Washington.
All meetings north of NE 8th Street are registered in District 15; all meetings south of NE 8th are registered in District 16.
